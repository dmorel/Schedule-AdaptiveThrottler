Schedule::AdaptiveThrottler

This module is a simple and rather generic throttler that can be used to allow
or deny anything based on a set threshold of arbitrary criteria.  Although it
is not very clear, the POD will make more sense when you have a look at it. In
short, it was designed to prevent DoS attacks on web services and brute-force
password cracking in web forms, but it can do a lot, lot more.  There is only
one prerequisite: the storage works with a memcached instance, but could work
with pretty much any key/value store, provided the get() and set() calls work
the same way as the memcached modules implement it.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

To test properly you can use a real memcached server. On a Unix box, it can be
as simple as running:
    
    memcached -d
    MEMCACHED_SERVERS=localhost:11211 make test

But you can also use the built-in mock memcached object, that relies on an
in-memory DB_File. This is the default 'make test' behaviour.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.
