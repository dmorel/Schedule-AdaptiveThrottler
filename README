BorderPatrol

This module is a simple and rather generic throttler that can be used to allow
or deny anything based on a set threshold of arbitrary criteria.  Although it
is not very clear, the POD will make more sense when you have a look at it. In
short, it was designed to prevent DoS attacks on web services and brute-force
password cracking in web forms, but it can do a lot, lot more.  There is only
one prerequisite: the storage works with a memcached instance, but could work
with pretty much any key/value store, provided the get() and set() calls work
the same way as the memcached modules implement it.
